    <h1>CF Montreal <img src="images/montLogo.png"> </h1>

    <p>Montreal CF is a soccer team located in the city of Montreal. Montreal were awarded Canada’s third MLS team in 2010. Montreal CF<br> were the 19th team to enter the MLS and began playing their games in the 2012 season. Saputo Stadium is a soccer-specific stadium with<br> a natural grass playing surface that was constructed in 2008 for the Impact de Montreal, a team that was playing in the second division at<br> the time. The stadium was intended to accommodate expansion as CF Montreal anticipated moving to Major League Soccer (MLS). The<br> Québec government announced plans to invest $23 million to build a synthetic turf training pitch next to the stadium and to enlarge the<br> stadium to accommodate more than 20,000 supporters. They have also played some of their games at the Montreal Olympic Stadium,<br> which holds around 61,000 people.</p>

    <h1>Notable Season</h1>

    <p>The 2022 MLS season was one of the best for CF Montreal. The club earned its highest-ever finish since entering the MLS, breaking<br> several club and league records in the process. Montreal concluded their regular season in second place in the Eastern Conference for<br> the first time in their MLS history, finishing with 65 points, only two points behind the Philadelphia Union. Another notable season was in<br> 2015, where they went all the way to the CONCACAF Champions League Finals. They did end up losing to Club America<br> - (the Mexican team) 5-3 on aggregate.</p>

    <h1>Logo Changes</h1>

    <p>Montreal has had three logo re-designs in its history. Below are all the logos they have used in the past and the current logo. The one<br> on the left was the original iconic logo, used from 2010 to 2021. The one in the middle was supposed to be the current logo, but many<br> fans did not like the design. This one lasted only from 2021–2022. The one on the right is the current logo, which was announced in<br> 2023. Many fans like the current logo. </p>
